# Alt Anon (Instance Currency Tracker)
Originally designed to track instance lockouts and currency information across all your characters and realms on multiple accounts, specifically for WOTLK.
The addon has now expanded to include much more information such as gear, professions, cooldowns, hence Alt Anon.
Also it provides a useful way to see missing enchants, gems, glyphs or ready cooldowns.

The addon uses IDs so should work in any language however labels are not localized.

Feel free to comment for additional features or suggestions.

## Viewing Frame
You can view either via the mini icon or via the Looking For Group Frame (`i` by default) if available in the version of the game.
This can be disabled in the options menu, and replaced with a minimap icon.  
Otherwise `/ict` will bring up the window.  

## Multiple Accounts
You can link your account to share character data. Accounts must be BNet friends with each other.
Click the cogwheel in the lower, then on both accounts select the other to link. This will enable
cross character communication while both accounts are on the same realm and faction to share data. Blizzard
doesn't allow addon's to communicate across realms or faction.
